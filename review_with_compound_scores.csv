"The media could not be loaded.This is a decent set of dumbbells, especially considering the price. I ordered 5 kg x 2 and they both weigh 5.2 each. The dumbbells look durable and I like the color (didn’t want the usual black ones).My only issue is that they’re quite bulky and look as if I’m lifting 10kg each.Read more",Positive,1
